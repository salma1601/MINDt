MINDt: small-animal MRI with pydicom, nipype and nilearn
========================================================

This repository contains code and documentation to use python
neuroimaging modules for small-animal MRI. The only
requirements are nipype, nilearn and nibabel ( http://nipy.org/nibabel ), as
well as their dependencies (numpy, scipy and matplotlib).

The code comes with fully-runnable examples that download the data
required from Internet.
