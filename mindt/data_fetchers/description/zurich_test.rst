ZURICH TEST-RETEST


Notes
-----
15 male C57BL/6J mice between 10 and 13 weeks old were scanned twice with 2
weeks between scan sessions. All mice were initially
anesthetized with isoflurane.
Throughout the course of the experiment, the animals were connected
to a small animal ventilator and mechanically
ventilated.The mouse head was immobilized using a bite bar and ear bars. Body
temperature was maintained at 36.5 ± 0.5 °C.
Following animal preparation,
the tail vein was cannulated for intravenous administration of a bolus of
0.05 mg/kg medetomidine; after 5 min, isoflurane was reduced and kept at 0.5%.
Continuous infusion of medetomidine was started 10 min after bolus injection at
adose of 0.1 mg/kg/h to maintain the sedation level. In combination
with the i.v. administered anesthetic, each animal received an injection
of pancuronium bromide.
The rs-fMRI dataset was acquired within a period of 6 min. After the
first MRI scan session, all mice were kept in a temperature-controlled chamber
under mechanical ventilation until they were able to spontaneously breathe.

MRI experiments were conducted using a Bruker 9.4 T.
An anatomical reference scan was acquired using a spin echo (Turbo-
RARE) sequence. BOLD fMRI experimental data were acquired using a gradient-echo
echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) sequence: FOV = 23.7 × 14 mm2,
MD = 90 × 60, yielding an in-plane voxel dimension of 263 × 233μm,
flip angle (FA) = 90°, bandwidth = 300 kHz, TR = 1000 ms, TE =10 ms, NA = 1.
